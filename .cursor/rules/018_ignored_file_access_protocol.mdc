# Ignored File Access Protocol

## When AI Needs to Access Ignored Files

### **🔍 Detection Indicators**
The AI should recognize these scenarios:
- User mentions files that AI cannot find through search
- Error messages about missing files that should exist
- Requests to edit files in excluded directories (`model_cache/`, `logs/`, `generated_images/`, etc.)
- Need to access configuration files in ignored locations

### **🤖 AI Response Protocol**

#### **Step 1: Acknowledge the Limitation**
```
"I notice that [file/directory] may be in .cursorignore and not visible to my search tools."
```

#### **Step 2: Request Explicit Path**
```
"Could you provide the exact file path so I can access it directly?"
```

#### **Step 3: Use Available Access Methods**

**Method A: Terminal Commands (Always Works)**
```bash
# List directory contents
ls -la [ignored_directory]/

# Read file contents
cat [ignored_file_path]
head -20 [ignored_file_path]
tail -20 [ignored_file_path]

# Search within ignored areas
find [ignored_directory] -name "*.ext" | head -10
grep -r "search_term" [ignored_directory]/ | head -10
```

**Method B: Direct File Tools (May Work)**
```
# These may work with explicit paths:
read_file "[explicit_path]"
edit_file "[explicit_path]"
search_replace "[explicit_path]"
```

#### **Step 4: Offer Solutions**
```
"I can help you temporarily modify .cursorignore if you need me to have broader access to this directory."
```

### **📋 Common Scenarios & Responses**

#### **Scenario 1: Log File Analysis**
```
User: "Check the latest error in the logs"
AI Response: "I need the specific log file path since logs/ is excluded from indexing.
Could you specify which log file? For example: logs/error.log or logs/application.log"
```

#### **Scenario 2: Model Configuration**
```
User: "Update the model config"
AI Response: "Model files are excluded from indexing for performance. Please provide the
exact path to the config file, such as: model_cache/models--[model_name]/config.json"
```

#### **Scenario 3: Generated Content Review**
```
User: "Review the generated images"
AI Response: "Generated content is excluded from indexing. I can access specific files
if you provide paths like: generated_images/image_001.png"
```

#### **Scenario 4: Build Artifacts**
```
User: "Check the build output"
AI Response: "Build directories are excluded. I can examine specific files if you provide
paths like: build/output.log or dist/bundle.js"
```

### **⚡ Quick Access Commands**

#### **Emergency File Access:**
```bash
# Quick directory overview
timeout 10 ls -la [ignored_directory]/

# File content preview
timeout 10 head -20 [ignored_file_path]

# Search for specific content
timeout 10 grep -r "error\|warning" logs/ | head -10
```

#### **Safe File Operations:**
```bash
# Check file exists before operations
[ -f "[file_path]" ] && echo "File exists" || echo "File not found"

# Get file info
timeout 10 file [ignored_file_path]
timeout 10 wc -l [ignored_file_path]
```

### **🚨 Important Limitations**

#### **What AI CANNOT Do with Ignored Files:**
- ❌ Find files through codebase search
- ❌ Include files in automatic context
- ❌ Suggest edits without explicit request
- ❌ See files in directory listings from search tools

#### **What AI CAN Do with Ignored Files:**
- ✅ Access files via terminal commands
- ✅ Read/edit files with explicit paths
- ✅ Search within files using command line
- ✅ Perform operations when given specific file names

### **🔧 Temporary Access Solutions**

#### **For User: Override .cursorignore Temporarily**
```bash
# Backup current .cursorignore
cp .cursorignore .cursorignore.backup

# Remove specific exclusion (e.g., logs/)
grep -v "logs/" .cursorignore > .cursorignore.tmp
mv .cursorignore.tmp .cursorignore

# Work with AI on the files

# Restore original .cursorignore
mv .cursorignore.backup .cursorignore
```

#### **For AI: Request Temporary Access**
```
"If you need me to have broader access to [directory], I can guide you through
temporarily modifying .cursorignore. This will allow me to see and work with
these files more easily."
```

### **📊 Performance Considerations**

#### **Current Exclusions (.cursorignore):**
- `model_cache/` - Large ML model files
- `node_modules/` - NPM dependencies
- `generated_images/` - Generated media
- `logs/` - Log files
- `venv/` - Python virtual environment
- `.git/` - Git internals
- `coverage/` - Test coverage data
- `test-results/` - Test output

#### **Why These Are Excluded:**
- **Performance**: 96% file reduction (121,657 → 4,441 files)
- **Memory**: 1.36 GB excluded from indexing
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents cursor-always-local rate limit errors
- **Focus**: Keeps AI context on relevant development files

## **🎯 Quick Reference for AI**

**When user mentions files you can't find:**
1. Acknowledge the `.cursorignore` limitation
2. Ask for explicit file path
3. Use terminal commands to access
4. Offer temporary exclusion override if needed

**Always available commands:**
```bash
ls -la [path]/
cat [file]
grep -r "term" [directory]/
find [directory] -name "pattern"
```
