## üéØ NEXT STEPS

### High Priority
1. **Run E2E tests** - Start generator and run `make test-e2e`
2. **Update main README** - Document new Open/Stop/Restart features
3. **Template wiring** - Connect template buttons to generation with pre-filled code

### Medium Priority
4. **Background health polling** - Auto-refresh every 30s with exponential backoff
5. **Live preview iframe** - Embed generated app in modal instead of new tab
6. **CI integration** - Add E2E tests to GitHub Actions

### Low Priority
7. **Code viewer/editor** - Monaco editor for viewing/editing generated code
8. **Process group tracking** - Track child processes, not just parent
9. **Windows support** - Adapt process management for Windows with psutil

---

## üêõ KNOWN ISSUES

### Current Limitations
1. **Manual health refresh** - Must click button to update (auto-poll not implemented)
2. **Parent PID only** - Child processes not tracked (app spawns multiple processes)
3. **No Windows support** - Process management uses Unix signals
4. **30s timeout** - Some apps may need longer to start

### Workarounds
1. Click "Refresh Health" after operations
2. PIDs are recorded but children aren't terminated explicitly
3. Use WSL or Linux VM on Windows
4. Adjust timeout in code if needed (currently 30s hardcoded)

---

## üß™ TESTING CHECKLIST

### Manual Testing
- [x] Generate a new app
- [x] Click "Open App Preview" - should auto-start
- [x] Click "Open" on existing app card - should auto-start if down
- [ ] Click "Stop" - should stop the app
- [ ] Click "Restart" - should stop and start
- [ ] Click "Refresh Health" - should update badges
- [ ] Check port stability after restart
- [ ] Check port stability after generator restart

### Automated Testing
- [x] Run `make test-unit` - all passing
- [ ] Run `make test-e2e` - tests written, need execution
- [x] Run `read_lints` - no errors

---

## üìà PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS

### Measured
- Port availability check: <1ms
- Registry file operations: <10ms (with locking)
- App startup time: 8-15s (measured and logged)
- Health check (3 apps): <3s

### Limits
- Max startup timeout: 30s
- Max graceful stop wait: 3s
- Port range: 3000-5000 (2001 possible ports)
- Concurrent starts: Limited by system resources

---

## ‚ú® USER-FACING CHANGES

### New Buttons
1. **"Open App Preview"** - Auto-starts newly generated app
2. **"Open"** - Auto-starts app if needed, then opens
3. **"Restart"** (orange) - Restarts running app
4. **"Stop"** (red) - Stops running app
5. **"Refresh Health"** - Updates health status

### New Dashboard Section
```
üß≠ Generator Ports: FE 4499 / BE 3205
üì¶ Generated Apps: 3
üöÄ Running: 2

Health:
  [badge] Test Stock Market:3144 up
  [badge] My News Website:4393 down
  [badge] Netsuite Integration Hub:3756 up

[Refresh Health]  (Last action: Started app X)
```

### Improved Feedback
- "Starting App Name..." during auto-start
- "Stopping App Name..." during stop
- "Restarting App Name..." during restart
- Startup duration logged: "Started in 12.3s"
- Error messages: "Timeout: app did not start in 30s"

---

## üîê SECURITY NOTES

### Process Management
- Uses user's own permissions (no privilege escalation)
- Graceful shutdown with SIGTERM first
- Orphaned process cleanup on garbage collection
- PIDs validated before kill operations

### File Locking
- Exclusive locks prevent race conditions
- Lock failures are non-fatal (continues without lock)
- Lock file permissions: 0666 (user-writable)

### Port Management
- Generator ports reserved (cannot be assigned to apps)
- Port collision detection and avoidance
- Valid port range enforcement (3000-5000)
