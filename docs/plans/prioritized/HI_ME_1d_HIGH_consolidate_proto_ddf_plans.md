# Consolidated Proto-DDF Development Plan

**Date**: October 13, 2025
**Status**: Active
**Project**: proto-ddf - Reflex Web Application Generator

---

## 📋 Context and Conversation Summary

### General Project Setup
The initial focus was on running the Reflex generation app from the submodule, using random ports (3000-5000), centralizing constants in config/, organizing the repository to separate generator from generated apps, removing localhost references, moving run.sh to workflows/, and adding comprehensive tests.

Key challenges included Python version compatibility, Reflex installation, type errors in rxconfig and generator, port conflicts, and missing run.sh.

### Jenkins CI/CD Integration
Subsequent integration involved sharing a local Jenkins instance across repositories, integrating proto-ddf, running the first build headlessly, and verifying all stages pass. This included pipeline implementation, helper scripts, documentation, and automated job creation.

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### From General Setup
1. Separate Port Ranges
2. Centralized Configuration
3. Repository Organization
4. Testing Strategy

### From Jenkins Integration
1. Declarative Pipeline with 7 Stages
2. Fresh Venv per Build
3. Non-blocking Quality Checks
4. Automated Job Creation via Groovy
5. CLI-based Headless Operation
6. Editable Reflex Install from Submodule

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Fixed (Merged)
All previously fixed issues from both plans.

### Current
None.

### Potential Future
- Port Exhaustion (mitigate with cleanup)
- Template Conflicts (add validation)
- State Persistence (add DB backend)
- Jenkins: Submodule init failures (ensure git commands)

---

## 📝 Important Notes

Merged notes from both: Don't modify submodule, test before commit, port management, configuration files, testing commands, deployment, etc.

Add Jenkins notes: Use helper script, daily workflow, maintenance.
