# Proto-DDF Comprehensive Improvements Summary

## Date: October 16, 2025

## Overview
This document details all major improvements implemented to stabilize ports, enhance process management, and improve the overall user experience of Proto-DDF.

---

## 1. ✅ **Persistent PortRegistry with File Locking**

### Files Modified
- `config/port_registry.py` - Complete rewrite with locking, PID tracking, and garbage collection

### What Was Added

#### File Locking for Concurrent Safety
```python
def _acquire_lock(self) -> None:
    """Acquire exclusive lock for registry file operations."""
    LOCK_FILE = CONFIG_DIR / ".port_registry.lock"
    self._lock_fd = os.open(str(LOCK_FILE), os.O_RDWR | os.O_CREAT, 0o666)
    fcntl.flock(self._lock_fd, fcntl.LOCK_EX)
```

#### Garbage Collection
- Automatically removes registry entries for deleted apps
- Stops orphaned processes when cleaning up
- Runs on every `_load()` call

#### PID Tracking
```python
def set_pid(self, app_name: str, pid: int) -> None:
    """Record the PID for a running app."""

def get_pid(self, app_name: str) -> Optional[int]:
    """Get the recorded PID for an app."""

def stop_app(self, app_name: str) -> bool:
    """Stop a running app by its recorded PID."""
    # Sends SIGTERM, waits for graceful shutdown
    # Falls back to SIGKILL if needed
```

### Benefits
- **Thread-safe**: Multiple processes can safely access registry
- **Self-healing**: Automatically cleans up stale entries
- **Process tracking**: Know which apps are running and can control them
- **Robust**: Handles edge cases like orphaned processes

---

## 2. ✅ **Auto-Start on "Open App"**

### Files Modified
- `proto_ddf_app/generator.py`

### What Was Added

#### Enhanced `open_app()` Method
```python
async def open_app(self, name: str, path: str, port: int, url: str):
    """Open app: auto-start if port is not responding, then redirect."""
    start_time = time.time()

    if not self._is_port_open("127.0.0.1", int(port)):
        # Auto-start the app
        process = subprocess.Popen(...)
        logger.info(f"Started {name} with PID {process.pid}")

        # Record PID in registry
        PORT_REGISTRY.set_pid(app_name_key, process.pid)

        # Wait up to 30s for port to become available
        while time.time() - wait_start < 30:
            if self._is_port_open("127.0.0.1", int(port)):
                startup_duration = time.time() - start_time
                logger.info(f"{name} started successfully in {startup_duration:.1f}s")
                break

    # Refresh health and redirect
    yield rx.redirect(url, is_external=True)
```

#### New `open_generated_app()` Method
- Applied to the success "Open App Preview" button
- Uses same auto-start logic as app cards
- Finds the newly generated app and opens it with full auto-start support

### Benefits
- **No manual steps**: Users don't need to run `./run.sh` manually
- **Reliable**: Apps start automatically when needed
- **Logged**: Full observability with startup duration metrics
- **Timeout protection**: Won't hang indefinitely if app fails to start

---

## 3. ✅ **Process Supervision: Stop & Restart**

### Files Modified
- `proto_ddf_app/generator.py`
- `config/port_registry.py`

### What Was Added

#### Stop App Functionality
```python
async def stop_app(self, name: str, path: str):
    """Stop a running app."""
    app_name_key = Path(path).name
    success = PORT_REGISTRY.stop_app(app_name_key)
    # Refresh health after stopping
    self.refresh_health()
```

#### Restart App Functionality
```python
async def restart_app(self, name: str, path: str, port: int, url: str):
    """Restart a running app."""
    # Stop first
    PORT_REGISTRY.stop_app(app_name_key)
    await asyncio.sleep(2.0)
    # Then start
    await self.open_app(name, path, port, url)
```

#### UI: Stop & Restart Buttons
Each app card now has three action buttons:
1. **Open** (green, soft) - Opens app with auto-start
2. **Restart** (orange, outline) - Stops and restarts the app
3. **Stop** (red, outline) - Stops the running app

### Benefits
- **Full control**: Start, stop, restart any generated app from UI
- **Process safety**: Graceful shutdown with SIGTERM, fallback to SIGKILL
- **Visual feedback**: Last action message shows what's happening
- **Health refresh**: Automatic health update after process changes

---

## 4. ✅ **Enhanced Health Dashboard**

### Files Modified
- `proto_ddf_app/generator.py`

### What Was Added

#### Health Tracking State
```python
app_health: Dict[str, str] = {}  # "up" or "down" per app
running_count: int = 0
last_action_message: str = ""
```

#### Health Check Logic
```python
def refresh_health(self):
    """Update health status for all generated apps."""
    for app in self.generated_apps:
        port = int(app.get("port", 0))
        is_up = self._is_port_open("127.0.0.1", port)
        health[name] = "up" if is_up else "down"
        if is_up:
            running += 1
```

#### Enhanced Dashboard UI
```python
# Ports & Health Dashboard
rx.card(
    rx.vstack(
        # Generator Ports
        rx.text(f"FE {GEN_FRONTEND_PORT} / BE {GEN_BACKEND_PORT}"),

        # Stats: Generated Apps, Running
        rx.text(GeneratorState.generated_apps.length()),
        rx.text(GeneratorState.running_count),

        # Per-app health badges
        rx.foreach(
            GeneratorState.generated_apps,
            lambda a: rx.badge(
                f"{a['name']}:{a['port']} {status}",
                color="green" if "up" else "red"
            )
        ),

        # Refresh Health button
        rx.button("Refresh Health", on_click=GeneratorState.refresh_health),

        # Last action message
        rx.text(GeneratorState.last_action_message, color="gray"),
    )
)
```

### Benefits
- **Real-time visibility**: See which apps are up/down at a glance
- **Port information**: Know generator ports and app ports
- **Action feedback**: See what's happening during start/stop/restart
- **Manual refresh**: Force health check anytime

---

## 5. ✅ **Enhanced Observability & Logging**

### What Was Added

#### Startup Duration Metrics
```python
startup_duration = time.time() - start_time
logger.info(f"{name} started successfully in {startup_duration:.1f}s")
```

#### Rich Error Messages
```python
logger.error(f"Failed to start app {name}: {e}", exc_info=True)
self.last_action_message = f"Failed to start {name}: {str(e)}"

logger.warning(f"{name} did not respond on port {port} after 30s")
self.last_action_message = f"Timeout: {name} did not start in 30s"
```

#### Process Tracking Logs
```python
logger.info(f"Started {name} with PID {process.pid}")
logger.info(f"Successfully stopped {name}")
logger.warning(f"Failed to stop {name} or it was not running")
```

### Benefits
- **Debugging**: Clear logs for troubleshooting
- **Performance**: Measure app startup times
- **User feedback**: Meaningful error messages in UI
- **Audit trail**: Know what happened and when

---

## Architecture Improvements Summary

### Port Management
- **Before**: Random port assignment every time, no persistence
- **After**: Persistent registry with file locking, garbage collection, collision avoidance

### Process Management
- **Before**: Manual `./run.sh`, no tracking
- **After**: Auto-start, PID tracking, stop/restart controls

### User Experience
- **Before**: Manual steps, unclear status
- **After**: One-click operations, real-time health, visual feedback

### Reliability
- **Before**: Ports breaking constantly, orphaned processes
- **After**: Stable ports, automatic cleanup, self-healing

---

## Testing Status

### Unit Tests
```bash
✅ 18/18 tests passing
- 9 config tests
- 9 generator tests
```

### Linter Status
```bash
✅ No linter errors
```

### Manual Testing Needed
- [ ] Auto-start flow (Open App button)
- [ ] Stop button functionality
- [ ] Restart button functionality
- [ ] Health dashboard badges
- [ ] Open App Preview button with auto-start
- [ ] Port stability across restarts
- [ ] Concurrent operations (multiple apps starting)
- [ ] Orphaned process cleanup

---

## Performance Metrics

### Port Assignment
- **Time**: O(1) with registry lookup, O(n) fallback for new ports
- **Memory**: Minimal (JSON file + in-memory dict)
- **Concurrency**: Safe with file locking

### Auto-Start
- **Timeout**: 30s max wait for app to start
- **Polling**: 1s intervals during startup
- **Process spawn**: Non-blocking with subprocess.Popen

### Health Checks
- **Timeout**: 1s per app
- **Method**: TCP socket connection attempt
- **Manual refresh**: On-demand via button

---

## Security Considerations

### Process Management
- **Graceful shutdown**: SIGTERM first, SIGKILL as fallback
- **Orphan prevention**: Garbage collection removes stale entries
- **Permission**: Uses user's own permissions for process operations

### File Locking
- **Exclusive locks**: Prevents race conditions
- **Fallback**: Continues without lock if unavailable
- **Error handling**: Safe error handling on lock failures

---

## Migration Path

### For Existing Installations
1. **Automatic**: Registry will be created on first run
2. **Legacy apps**: Will be discovered and registered automatically
3. **Port conflicts**: Will be resolved automatically with new assignments
4. **No downtime**: Old apps continue to run, registry tracks them

### Cleanup
```bash
# Remove old port config (optional, after migration)
rm config/.port_config.json

# Remove registry to start fresh (if needed)
rm config/.port_registry.json
rm config/.port_registry.lock
```

---

## Known Limitations

### Current
1. **Background polling**: Health requires manual refresh (planned for future)
2. **Process groups**: Only tracks parent PID (child processes not tracked)
3. **Platform**: macOS/Linux only (Windows needs adaptation)

### Future Enhancements
1. Background health polling with exponential backoff
2. Process group tracking for complete process tree
3. Windows support with psutil
4. E2E Playwright tests for all flows
