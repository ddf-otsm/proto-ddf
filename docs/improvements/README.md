## Testing New Features

### Run Unit Tests
```bash
make test-unit
# or
./venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit/ -v
```

### Run E2E Tests (when implemented)

# or
./venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/e2e/ -v
```

### Manual Testing
1. Start the generator: `make run`
2. Open http://localhost:<FRONTEND_PORT>
3. Test features:
   - Click "Open App" on any generated app
   - Use "Stop" and "Restart" buttons
   - Click "Refresh Health"
   - Generate a new app and use "Open App Preview"

## Performance Benchmarks

- Typical app startup: 8-15 seconds
- Maximum timeout: 30 seconds
- Health check interval: 1 second

### Port Operations
- Port availability check: <1ms
- Registry file operations: <10ms (with locking)
- Health refresh (3 apps): <3 seconds
