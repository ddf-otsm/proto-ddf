# Generated Applications

This directory contains Reflex applications generated by Proto-DDF.

## Structure

Each subdirectory represents a generated application with its own:
- Application code (`proto_ddf_app/`)
- Configuration (`rxconfig.py`)
- Requirements (`requirements.txt`)
- Logs and data

## Currently Generated Apps

### NetSuite Integration Hub
- **Path**: `netsuite_integration_hub/`
- **Description**: Multi-source data integration showcase
- **Features**:
  - 6 data source types (CSV, JSON, Database, REST API, Salesforce, Webhook)
  - Real-time sync with progress tracking
  - Intelligent field mapping
  - Statistics dashboard
  - Integration logs

## Running a Generated App

To run a generated app, navigate to its directory and run:

```bash
cd generated/netsuite_integration_hub
source ../../venv/bin/activate
reflex run
```

Or use the main generator interface to manage and launch apps.

## Port Configuration

Each app shares the centralized port configuration from `config/` in the root directory:
- Ports are randomly assigned (3000-5000)
- Ports persist across restarts via `config/.port_config.json`
- To reset ports, delete the config file

## Adding Custom Apps

You can manually add apps to this directory or use the Proto-DDF generator interface to create new ones.
