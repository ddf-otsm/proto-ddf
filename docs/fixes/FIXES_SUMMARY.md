# Debugging & Fixes Summary

## üéØ What Was Fixed

### Issue: Worker Crashes
```
[ERROR] Unexpected exit from worker-1
[ERROR] Unexpected exit from worker-1
...
```

### Root Cause
**Python 3.9.6** ‚Üí Reflex requires **Python 3.10+**

Workers were crashing because:
1. Your venv was created with Python 3.9
2. Reflex submodule uses Python 3.10+ features
3. Workers failed silently when hitting incompatibilities

## ‚úÖ All Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Logging System
- **rxconfig.py**: Framework-level logging
- **proto_ddf_app.py**: Application-level detailed logging
- **Log files**: proto_ddf.log, integration_hub.log
- **Try-catch**: All State methods wrapped with error handling
- **Stack traces**: Full exception details captured

### 2. Debug Tools Created
- **debug_server.sh**: Run app with maximum debugging
- **DEBUGGING.md**: Complete debugging guide
- **.gitignore**: Prevents committing log files

### 3. Python Version Checks
- **run.sh**: Now checks Python version BEFORE creating venv
- **Clear errors**: Shows installation instructions if wrong version
- **Early detection**: Fails fast with helpful message

### 4. Comprehensive Documentation
- **PYTHON_VERSION_ISSUE.md**: How to fix Python version
- **DEBUGGING.md**: Full debugging guide
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: System architecture details
- **FIXES_SUMMARY.md**: This file

## üìä Logging Features

### What Gets Logged

**Every State method logs**:
```python
def select_source(self, source: str):
    logger.info(f"select_source called with: {source}")  # Entry
    # ... processing ...
    logger.debug(f"Loaded source fields: {fields}")      # Details
    logger.info(f"Successfully selected source")         # Success
```

**On errors**:
```python
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error in method: {str(e)}", exc_info=True)
    # exc_info=True captures full stack trace
```

### Log Format
```
2025-10-09 14:30:00 - proto_ddf_app - INFO - select_source:108 - select_source called with: CSV File
    ^timestamp         ^module          ^level  ^function:line     ^message
```

### Log Files

| File | Purpose | Content |
|------|---------|---------|
| proto_ddf.log | Configuration & framework | App startup, config loading, network binding |
| integration_hub.log | Application logic | State methods, data processing, sync operations |
| debug_output.log | Complete output | Everything from debug_server.sh |

## üöÄ How to Use

### Quick Start (After Fixing Python)

```bash
# Install Python 3.10+
brew install python@3.10

# Recreate venv
rm -rf venv
python3.10 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install -e ./reflex

# Run normally
reflex run

# OR run in debug mode
./debug_server.sh
```

### Monitor Logs

```bash
# Real-time monitoring
tail -f proto_ddf.log integration_hub.log

# Find errors
grep ERROR *.log

# Find specific operations
grep "select_source called" integration_hub.log
grep "sync_to_netsuite" integration_hub.log
```

## üîç Debugging Workflow

1. **Run in debug mode**
   ```bash
   ./debug_server.sh
   ```

2. **Monitor logs in another terminal**
   ```bash
   tail -f *.log
   ```

3. **Perform action in UI**
   - Click source card
   - Connect to source
   - Sync data

4. **Check logs for details**
   ```bash
   grep "select_source called" integration_hub.log
   ```

5. **If error occurs, check full trace**
   ```bash
   grep -A 10 "ERROR" integration_hub.log
   ```

## üì¶ Files Modified

### Configuration Files
```
rxconfig.py
  + import logging
  + logging.basicConfig(...)

## üéØ Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Fix Python version (see PYTHON_VERSION_ISSUE.md)
2. ‚úÖ Test application runs without worker errors
3. ‚úÖ Verify logs are being created
4. ‚úÖ Test all 6 data sources
5. ‚úÖ Check logs show detailed operations
6. ‚úÖ Access from network devices

## üí° Tips

### For Development
- Keep `tail -f *.log` running in a separate terminal
- Check logs after every feature test
- Add more logging as you add features

### For Production

- Monitor for ERROR patterns
- Set up alerts for critical errors

### For Debugging
- Start with debug_server.sh
- Check integration_hub.log first
- Look for the last successful operation
